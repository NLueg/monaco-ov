## Documentation

When starting the project, the language-server gets automatically started in the background.
The language-server provides the functionallity for openVALIDATION.
In addition to the LSP, we provide semantical highlighting for openVALIDATION-Code

There are a few extensions for the protocol during the case that openVALIDATION needs some additional parameters for parsing.

First wie added a toggle for the natural- and programming-language which is used for parsing.
They can be set with the notification `openVALIDATION/cultureChanged` and `openVALIDATION/languageChanged`.

In addition we send the schema from the monaco-client to the language-server with `openVALIDATION/schemaChanged`.

Lastly we can receive the generated code from the language-server with the notification `openVALIDATION/generatedCode`.

The integration of monaco with the language-server happens in the [LspClient.ts](https://github.com/NLueg/monaco-ov/blob/master/src/client/LspClient.ts).
